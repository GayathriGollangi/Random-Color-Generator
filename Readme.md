Project description
In this particular project, our goal is to develop a tool that generates random colors. The final version of this project showcases a website that features multiple colors, each with its unique code. One of the exciting features of this tool is that when you refresh the webpage, the colors and their codes change randomly. To create these randomly generated color codes, we are utilizing JavaScript. This script ensures that the colors and codes are different each time for up to 30 color containers. In addition, the website is also designed to be responsive. This means that the site adapts to different screen sizes. For example, when the website is viewed on a larger screen, it displays the colors in four columns. However, as the screen size decreases, the columns are reduced to three, two, and ultimately one column. This allows for a seamless user experience, regardless of the screen size.
